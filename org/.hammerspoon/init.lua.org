* Hammerspoon

  I started using Hammerspoon for window management.

** Reloading

   Before we get going, we setup how to reload.

   It is helpful that this appears first in the file. This placement
   ensures that you will always be able to reload. This is especially
   helpful if you introduce an error below that halts reloading.

   #+BEGIN_SRC lua :tangle ../../home/.hammerspoon/init.lua
     hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "shift", "ctrl"}, "R", function()
       hs.reload()
     end)
     hs.alert.show("Hammerspoon: Online")
    #+END_SRC

** Simpler Window Management

   I am trying the following (on MacOS):

   1. Applications associated with any single "Project" live in a
      single "Desktop."
   2. By "Desktop" I mean the things you see when you press F3. The
      things you can switch between by pressing =CTRL-LEFT_ARROW= and
      =CTRL-RIGHT_ARROW=.
   3. By "Project" I mean a functional task that you work on: Work
      Email, Work Chat, Personal Email, Personal Chat, Music, Editor,
      Terminal, Editor and Terminal. This list constitutes 8 Projects
      and, in turn, 8 Desktops.
   4. If you are liberal with the amount of Desktops you create then
      each Desktop will have just a few Applications.
   5. Perhaps you do not need a powerful "tiling" Window Management
      System.
   6. Perhaps you will be able to manage just one or two windows.

   With this in mind, the following keybindings are setup to follow
   [[https://github.com/jedcn/getting-started-with-slate/blob/master/README.md#size-and-placement][the mnemonic of the "numpad:"]]

   The homerow (=J=, =K=, =L=) represents the most popular
   keybindings. When =CMD-CTRL-SHIFT= is pressed with these keys you
   will make the currently focused window take up:

   1. The left 1/2 of the screen
   2. The whole screen
   3. The right 1/2 of the screen

   If you are using a big monitor or you like to see some visual space
   between windows, you can use the topmost row (=U=, =I=, =O=). It
   will make the currently focused window take up:

   1. 90% of the left 1/2 of the screen
   2. 90% of the whole screen
   3. 90% of the right 1/2 of the screen

   And finally, if you use the lowest row (=m=, =,=, =.=) it will make
   the currently focused window take up:

   1. 80% of the whole screen
   2. 70% of the whole screen
   3. 60% of the whole screen

   The thinking with this row is that when you are using a very large
   monitor you want to focus your line of sight and gaze at the center
   of the monitor. If any single application takes up too much
   geographic real estate, you will end up looking at the corner of
   your monitor too frequently.

*** Details

    I like my Windows to snap into place, and so we turn off animation:

    #+BEGIN_SRC lua :tangle ../../home/.hammerspoon/init.lua
      -- disable window move animations
      hs.window.animationDuration = 0
   #+END_SRC

    I am new to lua, and could not easily see how to do the equivalent
    of =a || b= from JavaScript, so I made this =first= function.

    #+BEGIN_SRC lua :tangle ../../home/.hammerspoon/init.lua
      -- a || b
      function first(a, b)
        if a then return a end
        return b
      end
   #+END_SRC

    This function, =changeFocusedWindow=, does the majority of the
    work.

    The desktop can be thought of as a (x,y) plane where the (0,0)
    point in the upper left hand corner.

    As x grows, you move from left to right.

    As y grows, you move from top to bottom.

    In practical terms, you cannot place a window so that it overlaps
    with the Apple bar across the top. This means the smallest value of
    y will be something like 23. In this case, the 23 represents 23
    pixels worth of the Apple bar height.

    You cannot also place a window so that it overlaps with the Dock,
    and some people put the Dock on the left. X would be zero without
    it, and something small like 50 with it.

    With that background, this function expects two arguments. The
    =changes= argument is expected to be a table and has defaults for
    all keys if a key is missing. The keys are:

    + =offsetFromLeft=: How much should the window be offset from the
      left described relative to the total size of the page?
    + =offsetFromTop=: How much should the window be offset from the
      top described relative to the total size of the page?
    + =widthRatio=: How much horizontal space should this window take
      up, relative to the total available width?
    + =heightRatio=: How much vertical space should this window take
      up, relative to the total available height?
    + =shrinkOrGrow=: Should the window be made smaller or larger, by
      the specified percentage, after it is resized? It will be
      centered in place.

    #+BEGIN_SRC lua :tangle ../../home/.hammerspoon/init.lua
      function changeFocusedWindow(changes, msg)
        local win = hs.window.focusedWindow()
        if not win then
          hs.alert.show('No window has focus.')
          return
        end
        local screen = win:screen()

        -- The desktop.width and desktop.height vary depending on screen. An
        -- example is 1440 and 873
        local desktop = screen:frame()
        local screenWidth = desktop.w
        local screenHeight = desktop.h
        local smallestX = desktop.x -- 0 if no dock on left
        local smallestY = desktop.y -- 23 because of apple bar across top

        local percentOfWidth = first(changes.offsetFromLeft, 0)
        local percentOfHeight = first(changes.offsetFromTop, 0)
        local widthRatio = first(changes.widthRatio, 1)
        local heightRatio = first(changes.heightRatio, 1)

        local f = win:frame()

        f.x = smallestX + (screenWidth * percentOfWidth)
        f.y = smallestY + (screenHeight * percentOfHeight)
        f.w = screenWidth * widthRatio
        f.h = screenHeight * heightRatio

        if changes.shrinkOrGrow then
           -- Shrink or Growth the Width..
           oldWidth = f.w
           changeInWidth = changes.shrinkOrGrow * oldWidth
           newWidth = oldWidth + changeInWidth
           f.w = newWidth

           oldHeight = f.h
           changeInHeight = changes.shrinkOrGrow * oldHeight
           newHeight = oldHeight + changeInHeight
           f.h = newHeight

           -- Re-center
           f.x = f.x - (changeInWidth / 2)
           f.y = f.y - (changeInHeight / 2)
        end

        hs.alert.show(msg)
        win:setFrame(f)
      end
    #+END_SRC

    Given the function above, we can describe a few constants that make
    things easier to reason about.

    And we can create a data structure that describes how we want
    keybindings setup.

    #+BEGIN_SRC lua :tangle ../../home/.hammerspoon/init.lua
      local HALF_HEIGHT = 0.5
      local HALF_WIDTH = 0.5
      local HALF_OF_SCREEN = 0.5

      local windowMgmtSetup = {
        {
          key = 'U',
          name = '90% of Left Half',
          values = { widthRatio = HALF_WIDTH,
                     shrinkOrGrow = -0.1 },
        },
        {
          key = 'I',
          name = '90% of Whole Screen',
          values = { shrinkOrGrow = -0.1 }
        },
        {
          key = 'O',
          name = '90% of Right Half',
          values = { widthRatio = HALF_WIDTH,
                     offsetFromLeft = HALF_OF_SCREEN,
                     shrinkOrGrow = -0.1 }
        },
        {
          key = 'J',
          name = 'Left Half',
          values = { widthRatio = HALF_WIDTH },
        },
        {
          key = 'K',
          name = 'Whole Screen',
          values = {}
        },
        {
          key = 'L',
          name = 'Right Half',
          values = { widthRatio = HALF_WIDTH,
                     offsetFromLeft = HALF_OF_SCREEN }
        },
        {
          key = 'M',
          name = '80% of Whole Screen',
          values = { shrinkOrGrow = -0.20 }
        },
        {
          key = ',',
          name = '70% of Whole Screen',
          values = { shrinkOrGrow = -0.3 }
        },
        {
          key = '.',
          name = '60% of Whole Screen',
          values = { shrinkOrGrow = -0.4 }
        }
      }

    #+END_SRC

    Finally, given the data structure above, we can iterate through it
    and set everything up. When this is done:

    + Each keypress will be registered
    + When pressed, the window will change shape and size
    + After moving to a new location, a small message will appear on
      the screen.

    #+BEGIN_SRC lua :tangle ../../home/.hammerspoon/init.lua
      local windowMgmtPrefix = { "cmd", "ctrl", "shift" }
      for i = 1, #windowMgmtSetup do
        local setup = windowMgmtSetup[i]
        local function moveWindow()
          changeFocusedWindow(setup.values, setup.name)
        end
        hs.hotkey.bind(windowMgmtPrefix, setup.key, moveWindow)
      end
   #+END_SRC


** Miscellaneous

*** WIFI

    Display "Wifi: <SSID>" whenever you connect, and "Wifi:
    Disconnected" if you disconnect.

    #+BEGIN_SRC lua :tangle ../../home/.hammerspoon/init.lua
      function alertOnSSIDChange()
         newSSID = hs.wifi.currentNetwork()
         if newSSID then
            hs.alert.show("Wifi: " .. newSSID)
         else
            hs.alert.show("Wifi: Disconnected")
         end
      end
      local wifiWatcher = hs.wifi.watcher.new(alertOnSSIDChange)
      wifiWatcher:start()
    #+END_SRC
