* ZSH and Oh My ZSH!

  One day, I started cleaning up my zsh. I began with [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/9d2b5c841e251840d7965163f4eb9797bc0db49f/templates/zshrc.zsh-template][here]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ../real/.zshrc
  # Path to your oh-my-zsh configuration.
  ZSH=$HOME/.oh-my-zsh

  # Set name of the theme to load.
  ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"

  # Disable command autocorrection
  DISABLE_CORRECTION="true"

  # Which plugins would you like to load? (plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*)
  # Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
  plugins=()

  source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
#+END_SRC
