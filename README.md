# Literately programmed dot files

Program in emacs and org-mode with babel underneath `org/`.

Emacs can weave `org/` contents and place results in `doc/`.

Emacs can tangle `org/` contents and place results in `home/`.

Homeshick links files underneath `home/` together.

Homeshick can overlay multiple "castles," so this castle could
contribute a ".zshrc" and different repository could contribute the
core of "oh-my-zsh."
